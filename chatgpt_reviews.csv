When asked when does usage resets, it responds by saying it doesn't have that information. What? Please don't buy the paid subscription. It is not worth the money or hassle. I canceled as soon as I discovered its inability to perform accurately and ineffectively. Buy Claude the flawed",85,2ff1445d-fce0-4d3a-b284-420d4637cf53

AND you have a weekly limit, you don't get to use it for 4 days if you use that up, unless you give them more money. After I dealt with the 4 day message cap, which is completely unacceptable for a service that you're paying for, I cancel my subscription and got a refund. I don't care how decent of a writer an AI is, locking it off for 4 DAYS when you pay a monthly subscription is garbage. I DON'T RECOMMEND!",1,53d58843-fca4-4581-ae07-9a4c6ee48ca2

Doesn't always revise what I ask it too misses things and it's frustrating. I have spent lots of time trying to find missing content in chats etc. Needs to be improved in these areas for larger files such as writing books. I also have to remind it sometimes dont add details I didn't write. Great for smaller projects though.,1,f1223b35-d7a7-4eb6-ae66-a84b7e93df4f
2025-11-29 02:24:59,Claude,1,"for whatever reason, the latest update decided to ruin everything about the UI with extended thinking. Not only does it automatically unselect extended thinking whenever I submit a prompt, forcing me to cancel early, turn thinking back on, and resubmit the prompt, but also there's a 'summary' of the thinking that just cuts off the thoughts early, only letting me see the first line and a half of the thought process.",1,cc5f7ab8-c55a-48db-adbe-a95ff866ae9d

Sometimes, it generates content on its own, so you need to be specific. I wish it had ChatGPT’s message limits (it can become restrictive over time, very restrictive). I can only send 2 messages, and then I have to wait 4 hours (I'm in free mode).

2025-10-13 17:54:11,Claude,3,"Based on the Pro subscription model, comparing to the same paid level between GROK and CHATGPT. While Claude has its positives, with simple input Claude will follow through with no issue. Unlike chatgpt, which pauses, omits, errors until user goes through 5 or more entries of the same request. That said, GROK efficiency excels both. Where Claude fails, is Restrictions upon PAID subscriptions, timeouts. The excuse ""so all users have access"" fails. Paid GROK PRO equals unlimited access.",0,a2869745-431e-49c9-8cbf-289c3fdcbec8
